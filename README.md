Check out [how it was made in a series of tweets](https://twitter.com/cgenco/status/1479144204043444226).

If you're just looking for the meat and potatoes of how the optimal best guesses get chosen check out [solver.js](https://github.com/christiangenco/wordlesolver/blob/main/src/solver.js).

For a more academic approach to solving this sort of problem, check out Donald Knuth's paper [The Computer As Mastermind](https://www.cs.uni.edu/~wallingf/teaching/cs3530/resources/knuth-mastermind.pdf) which is about a similar algorithm for solving a similar game.
